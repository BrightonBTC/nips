======

Location Based Communities (Meetup Style)
------------------------------------

`draft` `optional` `author:brighton_btc`

The purpose of this NIP is to create location based communities that allow for some light moderation, leverage NIP-52 time based calendar events for the creation of in-person meetup events, NIP-51 lists for membership and moderation, and NIP-28 for community chat.

# Community creation event:
New communities are created with a `Kind:1037` event. This event acts as an anchor point for other event kinds associated with the community

```json
{
  "content": <Optional description>,
  "created_at": <Unix timestamp in seconds>,
  "id": <32-bytes lowercase hex-encoded SHA-256 of the the serialized event data>,
  "kind": 1037,
  "pubkey": <32-bytes lowercase hex-encoded public key of the event creator>
}
```

# Community metadata:

Community metadata can be created or updated with a `Kind:30037` event. It should use the ID of the associated `Kind:1037` as its `d` tag.

```json
{
  "content": <description of community, markdown formatted>,
  "created_at": <Unix timestamp in seconds>,
  "id": <32-bytes lowercase hex-encoded SHA-256 of the the serialized event data>,
  "kind": 30037,
  "pubkey": <32-bytes lowercase hex-encoded public key of the event creator>,
  "tags": [
    ["title", <Community name>],
    ["d", <UID, ID of the associated 1037 event  >],
    ["image", <optional image URL>],
    ["g", <geohash>, "geohash"],
    ["g", <Alpha2 Country Code:City Name>, "city"], // eg "GB:Brighton"
    ["t", <string>] // can be multiple t tags
  ]
}

```

# Following communities

Users follow communities by adding the `Kind:1037` (Community creation event) id as an `e` tag to a `Kind:10037` event. 

Users can also add extra metadata, such as location `g` tags, to this event. This enables clients to build in discoverability options for their users.

```json
{
  "content": <User status>, // optional
  "created_at": <Unix timestamp in seconds>,
  "id": <32-bytes lowercase hex-encoded SHA-256 of the the serialized event data>,
  "kind": 10037,
  "pubkey": <32-bytes lowercase hex-encoded public key of the event creator>,
  "tags": [
    ["e", <id of an associated 1037 event>],
    ["e", <another id of an associated 1037 event>],
    // etc...

    // Suggested optional tags:
    ["locationStatus", <living | visiting>],
    ["g", <Alpha2:City>, "city"], // eg "GB:Brighton"
    ["t", <topic 1>],
    ["t", <topic 2>]
    // etc...
  ]
}
```

# Time-Based Calendar Event (NIP-52):

The owner of a community can create `Kind:31923` calendar events to represent location based, in person, meetup events. It's `d` tag should be the ID of the associated `Kind:1037` event.

In addition to the fields mentioned in NIP-52 there is also the following:

- an additional "g" tag formatted as the city g tags above. ie. Alpha2:City Name. This makes it possible to search by city. 
- an ["L" , "kind"] and ["l", "meetup", "kind"] tag so that these evnts can be differentiated from those that don'e have a community associated with them
- an "e" tag referencing the associated community.
- an optional "brief" tag, for a short description of the event

This gives us:

```json
{
  "content": <markdown formatted event description>,
  "created_at": <Unix timestamp in seconds>,
  "id": <32-bytes lowercase hex-encoded SHA-256 of the the serialized event data>,
  "kind": 31923,
  "pubkey": <32-bytes lowercase hex-encoded public key of the event creator>,
  "tags": [
    ["d", <UID, ID of the associated 1037 event  >],

    ["name", <name of calendar event>],

    // Dates
    ["start", <Unix timestamp in seconds>],
    ["end", <Unix timestamp in seconds>],

    // Location
    ["location", "<location>"],
    ["g", <geohash>, "geohash"],
    ["g", <Alpha2:City>, "city"],

    // Hashtags
    ["t", "<tag>"],
    ["t", "<tag>"],
    
    // addition fields
    ["brief", <brief description>],
    ["e", <id of the associated 1037 event>],
    ["L", "kind" ],
    ["l", "meetup", "kind"],
    
  ]
}
```

# RSVPing to community events

See NIP-52 `Kind:31925` events

# Community moderation

A user can be considered as one of 3 levels by a community: follower, member, or muted.

- **Member** - Is following the community (community ID exists in the users `Kind:10037` list) AND the users hex public key exists in the community's `Kind:30000` member list.
- **Follower** - Is following the community (community ID exists in the users `Kind:10037` list) BUT the users hex public key DOESN'T exist in the community's `Kind:30000` member list.
- **Muted** - Is following the community (community ID exists in the users `Kind:10037` list) AND the users hex public key exists in the community's `Kind:30000` block list. 

The community owner manages 2 `Kind:30000` (NIP-51) lists, one for members, one for muted/blocked users. The member event should include a `d` tag that mirrors the ID of the associated `Kind:1037`, and the muted list should be the `Kind:1037` with `:blocked` appended.

### Member list

```json

"kind": 30000,
  "tags": [
    ["d", <UID, ID of the associated 1037 event  >],
    ["p", "3bf0c63fcb93463407af97a5e5ee64fa883d107ef9e558472c4eb9aaaefa459d"],
    ["p", "32e1827635450ebb3c5a7d12c1f8e7b2b514439ac10a67eef3d9fd9c5c68e245"],
    // ...etc.
  ]
```

### Muted list

```json

"kind": 30000,
  "tags": [
    ["d", <UID, ID of the associated 1037 event  > + ":blocked"],
    ["p", "3bf0c63fcb93463407af97a5e5ee64fa883d107ef9e558472c4eb9aaaefa459d"],
    ["p", "32e1827635450ebb3c5a7d12c1f8e7b2b514439ac10a67eef3d9fd9c5c68e245"],
    // ...etc.
  ]
```


# Community Chat

Community chat can be implemented using NIP-28. The `Kind:40` chat creation event should include include an `e` tag that references the community `Kind:1037` event. Chat can be moderated as described above in the Community moderation section.
